# dart_initializing_cheat_sheet

Created this as a reference guide for initializing in Dart.

The specific reference library code file can be found at `cli/bin/cli.dart`.

If you want to modify/play with/run the code for any reason:
1) clone the repo,
2) the entrypoint is in `bin/` 
3) from the command line -> `$ dart run cli.dart`
